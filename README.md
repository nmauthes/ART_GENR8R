# ART_GENR8R

My Java-based translation/modification of this Python project: https://jeremykun.com/2012/01/01/random-psychedelic-art/

Below is an example image generated using my implementation.

Written in my free time using [Processing](https://processing.org/) to generate the images. I occasionally run it on my Raspberry Pi and screen at home when I feel like my room needs an aesthetic boost :) It will generate a new image every 15 seconds.
