# ART_GENR8R

My Java-based translation of this Python project: https://jeremykun.com/2012/01/01/random-psychedelic-art/

Written in my free time using [Processing](https://processing.org/) to generate the images. I occasionally run it on my Raspberry Pi + screen at home when my room needs an aesthetic boost. It will generate a new image every 15 seconds.
